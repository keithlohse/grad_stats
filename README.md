# grad_stats
Graduate statistics course covering basic estimation, the general linear model, and applications into more complex crossed and nested models. 

All analyses are taught using the general linear model and a model comparison approach.
 
Please note that all of the materials in this repository are based on supporting materials for a graduate statistics classes taught by Keith Lohse while at the University of Utah and Auburn University. The supplemental text for the course was: Judd, C. M., McClelland, G. H., & Ryan, C. S. (2011). Data analysis: A model comparison approach. Routledge.
 
Video lectures are all available on YouTube (linked below). Note that Sections 1-11 focus on conceptual understanding of the different methods and study designs (corresponding slides are in the "lectures" folder). Section 12 is an applied "how to" section about how to implement these analyses in R using example datasets (all scripts are in the "scripts" folder), which assumes a deeper unstanding of the concepts. I strongly recommend you *do not* jump into the application section without a solid understanding of the fundamentals covered in the previous sections. Example lab assignments to test your understanding (with answer keys) are in the "lab_assignments" folder.
